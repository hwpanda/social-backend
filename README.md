# Prototype Social Media Backend Python Django Application

## Overview

This project involves the development of a robust and scalable social media application using the Python Django framework. The application provides a comprehensive suite of functionalities centered around user interactions, tweet management, and real-time data processing. The project is structured in phases:

### Phase 1: Core Functionality (Completed)

- **RESTful API Development**: Designed and implemented RESTful API endpoints using the Python Django framework. These APIs handle critical functionalities including user registration, authentication, tweet creation, retrieval, and user engagement.
- **Codebase Modularity and Scalability**: Ensured the codebase is modular and scalable, adhering to software design principles for maintainability and extensibility.
- **Unit Testing**: Designed and wrote comprehensive test cases for unit testing to ensure the quality and performance of the application.
- **API Endpoints for Tweet Management**: Developed various API endpoints for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting tweets, enabling users to seamlessly interact with the platform.
- **Database Design with PostgreSQL**: Utilized PostgreSQL to construct an efficient relational database. This database manages user profiles, tweets, followers, and supports complex relationships between different entities.

### Phase 2: Core Functionality (in progress)

- **Implementing More API Endpoints**

### Phase 3: Performance Enhancements and Deployment (Upcoming)

- **Implementation of Redis and Memcached**: Plan to integrate Redis and Memcached for caching purposes to reduce database queries, thereby enhancing the application's performance.
- **Database Denormalization**: Implement denormalization strategies to optimize the database for read-heavy operations.
- **Refactoring HBase Implementation**: Aim to refactor the HBase usage to split database queries more efficiently, catering to the scalability requirements.
- **Deployment on Amazon S3**: Future deployment is planned on Amazon S3 for reliable and scalable cloud storage solutions.
- **Refactoring Message Queue**: Intend to refactor the existing message queue system to deliver asynchronous tasks, which is expected to significantly reduce the response time and improve the overall user experience.
